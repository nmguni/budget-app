## What I learned.
- Planning project architecture is vital to making a large application 
- First time using modules. Modules keep the units of code for a project cleanly separated. They encapsulate some data into privacy and       expose other data publicly  
- Had lots of practise with DOM manipulation  
- Built constructor functions 
- Learned to use the DRY principle when building functions in javascript( DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. The  main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code. Write Everything Twice (WET)
